Description: This package primarily identifies variants in mitochondrial genomes from BAM alignment files; filters these variants to remove RNA editing events; estimates their evolutionary relationship (i.e. their phylogenetic tree); groups single cells into clones using a probabilistic approach; visualizes the mutations and provides context in relation to genomic annotations.
